# Ruby Hashes 1/5/23

# Structure of a hash
    # HASH - unordered collection of unique keys and their values
    # Defining keys and values with => hash rocket or : 

    # 1st TECHNIQUE
    # newer syntax
    disney_inspiration = {
    merida_quote: 'Our fate lives within us. You only have to be brave enough to see it.',
    dumbo_quote: "Don't just fly, soar.",
    rafiki_qoute: 'The past can hurt, but the way I see it you can either hide from it or learn from it.'
    }
    # hash rocket not necessary because using a symbol
    # symbol is key with a colon on the right

    p disney_inspiration
    # output: displayed in the older syntax
    # {:merida_quote=>"Our fate lives within us. You only have to be brave enough to see it.", :dumbo_quote=>"Don't just fly, soar.", :rafiki_qoute=>"The past can hurt, but the way I see it you can either hide from it or learn from it."}

    # Hash rocket is required when not using a symbol
    # EXAMPLE-----

    # office_space = {
    #     44 => 'Charlean at the desk',
    #     'desk' => 'ergonomic, black, standup desk'
    # }
    # p office_space
    # output: {44=>"Charlean at the desk", "desk"=>"ergonomic, black, standup desk"}

    # 2nd TECHNIQUE - new method
    looney_talk = Hash.new
    # p looney_talk
    # output: {}
# Display/create/update/delete content from the hash
    # CREATE 
    # READ (displaying content)
    # All the pairs in the has

    # DELETE
    # delete is a method that requires an arguement in order to reference a key we will have to use ()

    looney_talk.delete(:slyvester_the_cat)

# Ducktyping - allows methods to be used in Ruby based on behavior instead of Ruby class

    # Modules - way of grouping like thinks with similar properties
    # Enumerable module - iterable group i.e. hashes, arrays, ranges

    # each for iteration
    #  map for transformation

    # EACH
    # looney_talk.each do |key, value|
    #     p "#{key} often says, #{value}"
    # end
    # output: "bugs_bunny often says, Whatz up, Doc?"
    # "road_runner often says, Meep Meep!"

        # output: "bugs_bunny says Whatz up, Doc? ðŸ§®"
        # "road_runner says Meep Meep! ðŸ§®"
